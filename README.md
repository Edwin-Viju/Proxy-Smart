## 🌟 Features  

✅ **Real-Time Alerts** – Instantly notifies users when an item moves beyond the set proximity.  
✅ **Customizable Distance Thresholds** – Set your preferred range via the mobile app.  
✅ **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Technology** – Ensures stable, energy-efficient connectivity.  
✅ **Dual-Device Alerts** – Alarm sounds on both the smart tag and smartphone.  
✅ **User-Friendly Mobile App** – Simple UI/UX for quick and easy operation.  
✅ **Secure Authentication** – Unique device ID & password protection.  
✅ **Lost-Device Recovery** – Helps users track misplaced items efficiently.
